# CareApp Project

CareApp is an attempt to simplify joining hands for social causes.

It helps us discover other people who share our passions like food distribution, book donation or helping seniors,
and let us communicate our drives or events so that others can participate.

We can see the drives and events in our city organized by others and can participate in the same.
